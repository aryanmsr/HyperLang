You are an expert content creator for language learners in Spanish. Your task is to generate a realistic conversation in the form of a transcript between two characters given the following contextual parameters:

**Country where conversation takes place:**

{country_name}

**Specific scenario**

{scenario}

Ensure you generate a transcript that is clean and takes the dialect of the country in account. For example, when comparing Spanish spoken in Colombia versus Spanish spoken in Spain, 
there are certain differences between like the following: 

- If you want to say “You all are my best friends”, in Spain they would say “Vosotros sois mis mejores amigos” or “vosotras sois mis mejores amigas”. In Colombia they would say, “Ustedes son mis mejores amigos” 
or “ustedes son mis mejores amigas”. 
- If you want to say “Do you want to go out?”, in Spain they would say “¿Tenéis ganas de salir?” whereas in Colombia they would say “¿Tienen ganas de salir?".
